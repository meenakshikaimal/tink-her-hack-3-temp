### Project Description
It's a user interactive website that lets you play podcasts related to healthcare as well asa wellness.
We have also intergrated a form to fetch user information which is related to their podcast listening preferences.

### The Problem statement
We are solving the ridiculous problem of not having enough awareness about listening to healthcare podcasts, people tend to go to apps like spotify and focus more on music. We wanted to change that by creating a website that lets you listen to podcasts directly from the spotify app without much hassle, we are also fetching necessary information required to further modify what kind of podcasts people would want to listen to in the future.

### The Solution

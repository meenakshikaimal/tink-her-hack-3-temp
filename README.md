### Project Description
It's a website that lets you play podcasts related to healthcare straight from spotify. It also takes user information regarding what type of podcasts they would like to listen to as well as their mail id and their wellness goals.

### The Problem statement
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, individuals seeking reliable healthcare and wellness information often struggle to find curated, expert-backed content in one centralized platform. Misinformation, fragmented resources, and a lack of easy access to trusted medical insights hinder individuals from making informed health decisions. Additionally, users often face challenges in discovering personalized healthcare content that aligns with their unique wellness goals.

### The Solution
This website serves as a comprehensive digital resource designed to address these challenges by:

Curating High-Quality Healthcare Podcasts – By embedding a selection of Spotify playlists and podcast episodes, users gain access to expert discussions on healthcare, fitness, and wellness in an easily accessible format.
Delivering Engaging Educational Content – A featured video on human connection in healthcare enhances user awareness and fosters a deeper understanding of patient-centered care.
Providing Reliable Medical Resources – The website links to medical blogs, the latest healthcare news, and a hospital locator, ensuring that users have real-time access to authoritative sources for their healthcare needs.
Personalizing User Experience – A user information form allows visitors to share their wellness goals and podcast preferences, enabling tailored recommendations for a more meaningful engagement.
Enhancing Credibility with Testimonials – Real user experiences and testimonials establish trust, encouraging new visitors to explore and engage with the content.
